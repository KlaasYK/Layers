# Layers

Displaying (horizontally) scrollable layer in front of fixed background layers.

Used in a project to display scrollable street of houses in front of a fixed background.

Works best on touch devices (just swipe). For desktop/laptop browsers: only an ugly scrollbar is used. This can be improved with some JavaScript to scroll the block (using the arrow keys or some fancy buttons).

The background image used was found in the public domain.
